    <p>
    In the last section I covered passing large amounts of data using the Application class to create a global reference.
    But experienced programmers can immediately spot the potential problems that can arise when using global references.
    One solution when working with large data that is difficult to pass between activities is to avoid using another activity if possible.
    I will cover two possible solutions here that will allow you to change the UI elements temporarily without leaving your current activity
    and therefore maintaining access to the data you are trying to display or manipulate.

    <p>
    The first option is using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/PopupWindow.html">PopUpWindow</a> class
    to temporarily display a new layout with new UI elements, partially or fully obscuring the UI of the current activity.
    Android provides adapter classes for easily displaying pop up dialogs with short messages and one InputText, but is possible
    to use the PopUpWindow class and a defined layout xml to create a pop up window with as many UI elements as needed.
    </p>

    <p>
    I used this solution in an app that was recording test data and displaying graphic representation and textual representations
    in new activities after the test had completed.  When the duration of the test was increased the app crashed when attempting
    to serialize the large arrays of recorded data.
        The data was simply too large to be passed between activities using a Bundle.
        The solution was to create a simple layout with a TextView within a
    ScrollLayout and display this array within this pop up window.  This not only prevented the app from crashing from the
    <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/TransactionTooLargeException.html">
        TransactionTooLargeException</a> but also greatly improved the speed of viewing the test results.  Below is the layout and pop up launching code.

    <p>
    Another solution is to use <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html">Fragments</a>
    to replace a section of the activity's UI without changing activities,  Despite the name you can even use a layout
    that is composed of only one fragment at a time.  Fragments share the same lifecycle as the activity but are useful
    when switching between related actions, such as viewing and editing and entity.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can change which fragment is currently visible using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/FragmentTransaction.html">FragmentTransaction API</a>
    .  In order to share data between the fragment and the activity you must declare public methods of the Activity and Fragment class.
    The activity can then be retrieved from the fragment using the <code>getActivity()</code> method and the fragments can be retrieved
    from the activity by using <code>getFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.FRAGMENT_ID)</code>.
    In the previous example of two activities that displayed and edited the same YouTube video snippet, instead of serializing
    the object between activities, The object would be maintained by the activity class and the fragments would get and modify the
    snippet objects through public methods defined by the activity class. Switching between viewing and editing would be done
    through fragment transactions instead of starting a new activity.
